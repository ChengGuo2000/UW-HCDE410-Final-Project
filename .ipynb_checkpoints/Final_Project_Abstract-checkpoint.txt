The Appearances and Edibility of Mushrooms - Abstract

This project is about building machine-learning models that can predict the edibility of mushrooms based on their appearance. The reason for doing this project is that I have friends who live in areas where mushrooms are abundant, and I am interested in knowing how to select edible mushrooms based on their shape in the wild, so I want to build this model based on a data set I found. I used data provided by mushroom researcher Dennis Wagner, which contains 17 qualitative characteristics, 3 quantitative characteristics, and edibility information for 61069 mushroom species. All data are generated from information on 173 species of mushrooms. Overall, I have explored the relationship between mushroom edibility and its appearance, and I found that size and color are not deterministic features of edibility, with larger mushrooms tending to be edible, contradicting our hypothesis. During data modeling, models with more features tend to perform better than models with only size and color features. In future research on mushrooms, we should consider more characteristics, including habitat and season, so that we can better predict mushroom edibility. Additionally, mushrooms that look similar tend to have the same edibility, so when building a model, k nearest neighbors would be a better choice.
