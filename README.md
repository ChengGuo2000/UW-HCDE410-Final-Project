## A4 - Preliminary Proposal
I am exploring the relationship between mushroom's appearance with whether it is poisonous or not. The project consists of a data exploration phrase, where I calculate some summary statistics and make visualizations of the mushroom appearances data, and a data modeling phrase, where I build a model that can predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or not from its appearances.
